# SimonGame
The Simon Game is a classic memory game that tests and challenges your ability to remember sequences of colors and patterns. Here's a description of the game:

The game is played on a device with four colored buttons or pads, typically red, green, blue, and yellow. These buttons are arranged in a circle or a square pattern.

The game starts by lighting up one of the colored buttons and playing a corresponding tone. The player's task is to watch, listen, and remember the sequence.

After the first color is displayed, the player must repeat the sequence by pressing the same colored button. If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game proceeds to the next level.

In the next level, the game adds another color to the existing sequence, creating a longer pattern. For example, if the previous sequence was red-green, the new sequence could be red-green-blue.
The Simon Game is not only a fun and engaging way to challenge one's memory but also helps develop cognitive skills such as pattern recognition, visual-auditory association, and concentration. It can be enjoyed by players of all ages and has remained a popular classic game for decades.
